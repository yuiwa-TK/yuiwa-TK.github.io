### Laminar-turbulent transition of a compressible boundary layer
This study aims in elucidating the wall heating/cooling effects on the laminar-turbulent transition of a compressible boundary layer over a zero pressure gradient flat plate using direct numerical simulations.

### Resolvent analysis 
Resolvent analysis reveals input-output relation within the complicated flow dynamcs based on the Navier--Stokes equations and temporal/spatial-averaged flow data.
It provides valuable insights for understanding, modeling, and control of flows.
This project attempts to extend the current framework of the resolvent analysis particularly to understand the compressible flows subject to heated/cooled wall, where the velocity and temperature are coupled nonlinearly.

## Past projects

### 2023

1. **Uncovering the self-sustaining mechanisms of transonic airfoil buffet**

We have identified the self-sustaining mechanisms of transonic airfoil buffet phenomena with the aid of the high-fidelity wall-resolved LES data, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and the resolvent analysis.
