Our new Open Access paper  ["Direct numerical simulation of subharmonic transition in pseudo-adiabatic, heated, and cooled boundary layers"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2025.109896) has appeared in International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flows!  In the paper, it was found from the DNS data obtained using Fugaku supercomputer that, at a specific condition, wall cooling can alter the transition scenario from H-type to O-type by suppressing the first (TS) mode's growth. Owing to the shift of transition scenario, the turbulent breakdown is delayed drastically. 
The [DNS database] presented in this paper will be available soon! (will be uploaded ["here"](https://www.klab.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/database/index_jpn.html))
