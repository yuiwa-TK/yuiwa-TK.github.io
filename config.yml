        Title: Yuta Iwatani
        Content: I am a third-year Ph.D. student [Aerodynamic Design Research Group](https://www.klab.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/index.html) at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), who is fascinated by the world of Fluid Dynamics and its underlying Mathematics.
                My current research numerically investigates how wall temperature affects boundary layer transition in the transonic regime, which is crucial phenomena for transportation and energy industry.    
                Beyond this, I am also developing advanced analysis methods, specifically based on resolvent analysis, to better understand and control intricate flow dynamics. 
                Currently, I am awarded by the [JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/).
