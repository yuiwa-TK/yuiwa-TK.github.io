        Title: Yuta Iwatani
        Content: I am a second-year PhD student affiliated with the [Aerodynamic Design Research Group](https://www.klab.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/index_jpn.html) at Tohoku University in Japan. 
                 I am awarded by the [JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/). 
                 My current research interest is persuing the physics in the compressible flow dynamics with the aid of high-fidelity numerical simulation and modal analysis to provide the insights/tools for the design of aircraft and/or the effective way of flow control in engineering.
